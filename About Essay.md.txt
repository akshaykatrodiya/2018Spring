# Introduction

### Akshay Katrodiya

Computer Science Experience: I've completed my under-graduation in Information Technolgy in India. I learned C++, basic java, database, Mathematics, and few other courses during my under-graduation. Later on, I placed into a company called Infosys Limited and worked around 1.8 years there. I have been trained in data warehouse testing where I learned SQL, Automation, ETL tools, testing strategies and a lot more things. After that, I decided to pursue my masters in the USA and so I'm here. During first two semesters here, I took some courses like Programming and Data Structures, Algorithm, Computer Systems, Data Science and few others. When I was in the last semester of my under-graduation I did my industrial training in one company called Alian Software and learned little bit web programming especially HTML and CSS. That time I built some web pages and learned bootstrap and applied it. Usually, everyone like an attractive and user-friendly website and so when I was learning web designing during last semester of under-graduation, I also wanted to build something more interesting but never got a chance.

How I'm gonna use this course in the future: I heard about java scripts, angular, Node, and all but never worked in or experienced with it. 
There are two reasons for choosing this course.

1) In the future, I would like to work in a testing field and so first wants to learn development of any website that has been built using javascript, angular, node etc so I can test things accurately.

2) My cousin brother is running a pharmacy business in Maryland so I want to build a good website on pharmacy process in order to handle orders and it's delivery through the website. As I built some good web pages long back ago I would like to learn more about concepts that I mentioned above and apply it in order to build that website by myself. I'm planning to spend some time in the next summer for this website and so I think this course will definitely help for that.

Thank you.
